  <h1>Work on Radioactivity</h1>
  <p>Marie Curie n√©e Marja Sklodowska (1867-1934) was one of the founders of the study of radioactivity. Born in Warsaw, she moved to Paris to study at the Sorbonne. She is best known today for the discovery and isolation of radium.This painstaking task, requiring years of patient work under laboratory conditions primitive even by late 19th-century standards and finally yielding a material so radioactive that it glows,contributed greatly to her heroic image. She and her husband Pierre also discovered polonium,which they named after her native Poland,partitioned at that time among the German, Austrian, and Russian empires.
<br><br>
She shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903, the same year she completed her doctoral dissertation. She, her husband Pierre Curie, and Henri Becquerel, were awarded the prize for their pioneering work on radioactivity. She was awarded the 1911 Nobel prize in Chemistry for her work in the discovery and isolation of the element radium. The name Curie lives on in the periodic table and among scientific units: the discoverers of element 96 named it curium, and a standard unit of radioactivity is called the curie.<br><br>

The fact that Marie Curie remains the only person to have won two Nobel Prizes in different sciences is sufficient testimony to the significance of her work and her place in the history of science. The fact that she did this work at a time when women were nearly non-existent in academic or industrial laboratories has given Curie nearly mythic status. Her achievements are so compelling that they captured the attention even of Hollywood (Madame Curie, 1943, starring Greer Garson). She is the female scientist nearly everyone can name.<br><br>

Before discovering elements, though, Curie carried out the work reported<br> in this selection, laying important foundations for further work on radioactivity. Neither Curie nor anyone else in 1898 had any idea of the nature of radioactivity or its cause.<br> The work described here is a model observational survey of a new field. <br>Explanations of radioactivity would only come after the systematic accumulation<br> and organization of information about the phenomenon.<br></p>
