Marie Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, in Physics, and with her later win,<br> in Chemistry, she became the first person to claim Nobel honors twice. <br>
Her efforts with her husband Pierre led to the discovery of polonium and radium, and she championed the development of X-rays.<br><br></p></div>

&nbsp; Marie Curie’s relentless resolve and insatiable curiosity made her an icon in the world of modern science.<br> Indefatigable despite a career of physically demanding and ultimately fatal work, she discovered<br>polonium and radium, championed the use of radiation in medicine and fundamentally changed our understanding of radioactivity.<br><br>

3.In 1911, for the isolation of radium, she was awarded another Nobel Prize, this time in chemistry.<br> She was and still is the only person to be awarded Nobel Prizes in two scientific categories. <br>By that time, Curie was world-famous, and the director of the Curie Laboratory at the newly established Radium Institute (today the Curie Institute).<br><br>

4.Curie believed scientific research was a public good and championed its utility.<br> She and her husband had discovered that radium destroyed diseased cells faster than healthy cells, and thus that radiation could be used to treat tumours.<br><br>

5.The discovery of radioactivity changed our ideas about matter and energy and of causality's place in the universe. <br>It led to further discoveries and to advances in instrumentation, medicine, and energy production.<br> It increased opportunities for women in science.<br><br>
